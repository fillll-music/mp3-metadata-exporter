## Coding Standards

### JavaScript

- Use ES6+ features where appropriate
- Follow consistent indentation (2 spaces)
- Use meaningful variable and function names
- Add comments for complex logic
- Use async/await for asynchronous operations

### HTML/CSS

- Use semantic HTML elements
- Follow consistent indentation
- Use meaningful class names
- Ensure accessibility (ARIA labels, proper headings)

### Electron-specific

- Keep main process code in `main.js`
- Keep renderer process code in `renderer.js`
- Use IPC (Inter-Process Communication) appropriately
- Handle errors gracefully

## Testing

### Manual Testing

Before submitting a pull request, please test:

1. **Basic functionality**: Can you select a directory and extract metadata?
2. **Error handling**: Test with invalid directories or corrupted files
3. **UI responsiveness**: Does the interface work smoothly?
4. **Cross-platform**: Test on different operating systems if possible

### Automated Testing
